# Level_Set_Methods_Exploration
Exploration of Level Set Methods

# Description
`main.m` contains a general implementation of the level set method for 2D applications. Parameters commented in caps can be modified by the user to run their own simulations.

`Examples` contains a list of pre-defined example tests

`Examples\circleAdvection.m` tests the advection of a circle in a constant flow field.

`Examples\squareAdvection.m` tests the advection of a square in a constant flow field.

`Examples\ZalesakDiskRotation.m` tests the rotation of a slotted disk in a rotating flow field.

`Examples\Breakup.m` tests the breakup of a slotted disk in a pinching flow field.

`Examples\Ring.m` tests the motion under mean curvature of a broken ring.
